3. Generate algorithms for solving each subproblem.
4. Combine the algorithms for solving the subproblems into a complete algorithm for solving the logical concept.
5. Evaluate the algorithm to make sure that it is clear, concise, easy to understand, efficient, and effective.
Example:
Logical concept: Sorting
Subproblems:
* Comparing two elements of a list
* Swapping two elements of a list
* Repeating a task until a condition is met
Algorithms for solving the subproblems:
* Comparing two elements of a list:
* If the first element is greater than the second element, return 1.
* If the first element is less than the second element, return -1.
* If the first element is equal to the second element, return 0.
* Swapping two elements of a list:
* Store the first element in a temporary variable.
* Store the second element in the first element slot.
* Store the temporary variable in the second element slot.
* Repeating a task until a condition is met:
* Perform the task.
* Check the condition.
* If the condition is not met, repeat the task.
Complete algorithm for sorting a list:
* Repeat the following steps until the list is sorted:
* Compare the first two elements of the list.
* If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
Evaluation of the algorithm:
* The algorithm is clear, concise, easy to understand, efficient, and effective.
This pseudocode can be used to program an LLM model to generate an algorithm for any logical concept. The LLM model can be trained on a dataset of text and code that includes examples of algorithms for solving different kinds of logical problems. Once the LLM model is trained, it can be used to generate new algorithms for solving new logical problems.
