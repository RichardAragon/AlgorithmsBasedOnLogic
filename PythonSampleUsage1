Given a list of unsorted elements, the following algorithm sorts the list in ascending order:

1. Compare the first two elements of the list.
2. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the entire list is sorted.

This algorithm is known as the bubble sort algorithm. It is a simple and efficient algorithm for sorting small lists.
