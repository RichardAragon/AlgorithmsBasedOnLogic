# Pseudocode:

def generate_algorithm(logical_concept):
    # 1. Prepare the request payload.
    payload = {
        "logical_concept": logical_concept

    # 2. Make the request to the LLM model.

    # 3. Check the response status code.

logical_concept = "Sorting"
algorithm = generate_algorithm(logical_concept)

# Print the generated algorithm.
print(algorithm)
